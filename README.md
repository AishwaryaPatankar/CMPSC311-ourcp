# CMPSC311-ourcp
A client-server application written in C and functionally similar to the `rcp` command.

## Current Project Structure
* The [`src`](https://github.com/eignnx/CMPSC311-ourcp/tree/master/src) directory holds all source files, executables, and a makefile.
  * The makefile can be used to compile the project more easily. See contents for examples of how to use.
* The file [`GithubForkAndBranchWorkflow.png`](https://github.com/eignnx/CMPSC311-ourcp/blob/master/GithubForkAndBranchWorkflow.png) shows an example workflow that may help getting started contributing if you need a GitHub refresher.

## Todo
- [ ] Create design specification
- [ ] Write server code
- [ ] Write client code
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Write man page for application
- [ ] Review assignment requirements and submit!
